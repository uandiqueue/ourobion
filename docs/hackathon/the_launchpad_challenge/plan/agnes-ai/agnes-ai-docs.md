## 3. Model Capabilities Overview

Agnes AI provides multiple types of model capabilities, including text models, image models, video models, and multimodal models.

The Agnes AI model suite includes text, image, video, and multimodal models designed for reasoning, creative generation, and production application scenarios.

These models help developers quickly integrate a complete AI capability stack, from content understanding and text generation to image generation, image editing, and video generation.

## 4. API Compatibility

Agnes AI API is compatible with OpenAI-style interfaces.

If you have already used an OpenAI-Compatible API, you usually only need to modify the following configurations:

* `Base URL`
* `API Key`
* `Model Name`

This compatibility allows developers to migrate existing projects quickly, reduce integration costs, and avoid duplicate development work.

## 5. Base URL

All API requests should be sent using the following Base URL:

Please make sure your request path is correctly built based on this address to avoid request failures caused by incorrect paths.

## 6. Authentication

All API requests must be authenticated with an API Key.

Include the following parameter in the request header, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with your valid API Key:

<span class="field-row"><code>Authorization: Bearer YOUR\_API\_KEY</code></span>

## 7. Security Notice

<Warning>
  Your API Key is sensitive information. Please keep it secure.

  Do not expose your API Key in:

  * Public code repositories
  * Front-end client code
  * Screenshots or screen recordings
  * Public documents
  * Configuration files accessible by others

  If your API Key is exposed, we recommend deleting or resetting it immediately in the console to prevent unauthorized usage.
</Warning>
